                <h1>Who?</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Vee - people know me as PurposeUnknown in various spaces, so sometimes I'm just called "Purpose". 
                   I'm a late20something trying to find her place in life, which so far has led me to interesting places, people, and a greater understanding of myself.</p>
                <p>The best way to describe me is "specialzed generalist" - I know a little bit about a lot of things, but I dont consider myself an expert in anything.
                I'm a former business intelligence (BI) specialist / logistics worker, and have basic knowledge of various technologies and programming languages.</p>
                <p>I enjoy exploring VR worlds, learning about cryptocurrency / blockchain, am a bit of a biohacker (trans woman), and like meeting new people.</p>
                <p>One of my goals is to learn web 3.0 and design; this website will serve both as an example and where I'll document my progress.</p>
